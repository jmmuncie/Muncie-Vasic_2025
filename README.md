* MIRA: https://mira-multiome.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

Subdirectories for "Seurat_Analyses" and "ArchR_Analyses" contain scripts for inital analyses (numbed "1_", "2_", etc.), as well as scripts specific to generating figure plots. The scripts for generating figure plots require that all inital analyses scripts have been completed.
